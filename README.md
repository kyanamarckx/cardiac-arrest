# :anatomical_heart::stethoscope: Cardiovascular diseases (heart failure)
> Kyana Marckx

This project focuses on preprocessing and feature analysis rather than comparing different models, as most related papers already do that extensively. Instead, a single model is trained (the one that generally performs best according to the literature) while experimenting with different preprocessing and feature analysis methods. This makes it possible to see how these choices affect model performance and to identify which preprocessing approaches lead to the best results.

## :heartpulse: Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the [Heart Failure Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction), publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/).

## :heartpulse: Installations
Inside the `imports`-folder is a notebook `installations.ipynb` that contains all the installation commands for the usd packages in this project. Run this file based on what packages are already installed on your device.

## :heartpulse: 1 - Exploration
Notebook `01-exploration.ipynb` dives into the exploration of the dataset; it executes the EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) in multiple different ways. Some generated plots are also saved accordingly inside the `media`-folder.

## :heartpulse: 2 - Preprocessing
Notebook `02-preprocessing.ipynb`

## :heartpulse: 3 - Modeling
Notebook `03-modeling.ipynb`

## :heartpulse: 4 - Evaluation
Notebook `04-evaluation.ipynb`
